plain and boring interface for RPI's printers

decided to break my c89(ish) prison for the cgi, i'll be using c++ sparingly to integrate it into the rest of the program. exceptions are nice.

todo:
-------
minor refactoring to clean up some functions
print out html
kerberos authentication (frontend)
